-- description: This is where you would put a one liner for the file.
-- tags: beta
-- created: <totally optional, nothing uses this field>

-- The migrate tool could be used to create a skeleton migration file.
-- This skeleton file would automatically have the PATCH, ID, and
-- author fields automatically filled out (or filled out by flag).
-- You could optionally add a description and optionally add tags.

-- It might be nice at some point in the future to have a patch
-- browser, which would let you search by description and author,
-- so when you wanted to build a prereq list, you could do so by
-- description or tag.
