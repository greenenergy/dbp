The system doesn't actually care what you use for ids, as long as there are no spaces or commas in the string
and that they're unique. It's convenient to use uuids, since they're pretty much guaranteed to be unique, but
you can actually use any string you want.

So I used readable filename-ish strings in this test set to make the loop obvious.
